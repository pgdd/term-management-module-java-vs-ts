# **Term Management System – Java vs. TypeScript**

## **Overview**

The **Term Management System** is a showcase project demonstrating how to manage, monitor, and enforce business terms and conditions in financial and operational systems. It uses an **event-driven architecture** powered by **Kafka** for asynchronous communication, **REST APIs** for data access, and a **PostgreSQL database** for persistence. The project is implemented in two programming languages: **TypeScript (Node.js)** and **Java (Spring Boot)**, highlighting both stacks' syntax, frameworks, and ecosystem.

Key design choices ensure the system is **modular**, **scalable**, and aligned with **object-oriented programming (OOP) principles**.

----------

## **Business Goals**

In industries such as **treasury management**, **trade risk management**, and **financial services**, enforcing business rules (terms) in real-time is critical. This system automates term management to:

-   **Ensure Compliance:** Monitor real-time financial data against predefined rules.
    
-   **Enforce Contracts:** Automate workflows tied to financial agreements.
    
-   **Mitigate Risk:** Trigger alerts or prevent violations such as trading overexposure.
    

----------

## **Getting Started**

### **Setup with Docker**

1.  Clone the repository:
    

```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/term-management-system.git
    cd term-management-system
```

2.  Start the services:
    

```
    docker-compose up --build
```

### Verify Services

After running `docker-compose up --build`, verify that the services are running:

-   TypeScript REST API: Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser or use `curl http://localhost:3000`.
    
-   Java REST API: Visit `http://localhost:8080` or use `curl http://localhost:8080`.
    

3.  Access the services:
    
    -   TypeScript REST API: `http://localhost:3000`
        
    -   Java REST API: `http://localhost:8080`
        

### Environment Setup

To set up the necessary environment variables:

1.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory of each project (`typescript` and `java`).
    
2.  Add the required variables as specified in `.env.example` (if provided) or based on the configuration documentation:
    

-   **.env.example**:
    
    ```
    DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
    PORT=3000
    ```
    
-   For **development**, use `.env.development` to specify variables needed for local testing.
    
-   For **production**, ensure all sensitive keys (e.g., `JWT_SECRET`, `DATABASE_URL`) are securely managed using tools like **Azure Key Vault** or **AWS Secrets Manager**.
    
-   Spring Boot profiles (`application-dev.properties` and `application-prod.properties`) are used to maintain separate configurations for Java.
    

### Branching Strategy

This project follows the **Git Flow** branching model:

-   **Feature branches**: Used for developing new features. These branches are branched off from `develop` and merged back into `develop` upon completion.
    
-   **Develop branch**: The main integration branch for feature branches. All ongoing development occurs here.
    
-   **Main branch**: Represents the stable, production-ready state of the project.
    
-   **Hotfix branches**: Used for critical fixes to the production code (branched off from `main` and merged back to both `main` and `develop`).
    

Ensure to run feature branches, then merge them into `develop` for continued development.

### Database Migration Setup

After setting up Docker, run the following script to migrate the database:

```
./scripts/migrate_db.sh
```

This script automates database migrations to set up the initial schema for PostgreSQL. For Java, tools like **Flyway** may be used for automated schema updates.

----------

----------

### **Scalability and Resilience**

1.  **Stateless Services:**
    
    -   Services are designed to be stateless, enabling horizontal scaling.
        
    -   Scaling managed via Azure App Service for Containers or Kubernetes (AKS).
        
2.  **Database Optimization:**
    
    -   Indexing critical database tables for faster queries.
        
    -   Connection pooling with tools like `pg-pool` (TypeScript) or Spring’s HikariCP.
        
3.  **Caching:**
    
    -   Use Redis or in-memory caching to reduce database load.
        
4.  **Container Orchestration:**
    
    -   Containerized services can be deployed on Kubernetes for automated scaling and high availability.
        

## **Architecture and Design**

### **Microservices Architecture**

The system follows a microservices pattern, decoupling functionalities into independent services:

1.  **Term Service:** Handles CRUD operations for terms and business logic for compliance.
    
2.  **Market Data Service:** Processes real-time data updates and generates Kafka events.
    
3.  **Audit Service:** Logs all changes and events for traceability.
    

### **Event-Driven Architecture**

-   **Kafka** enables decoupled communication between services:
    
    -   **Producers:** Services generating events (e.g., `MarketDataUpdate`).
        
    -   **Consumers:** Services reacting to events (e.g., compliance checks).
        
-   **Scalability:** Kafka ensures that services handle high volumes of asynchronous data.
    

## **Testing and CI/CD**

### Running Tests

To run tests locally for each service:

-   **TypeScript (Node.js)**:
    

```
npm test
```

-   **Java (Spring Boot)**:
    

```
./mvnw test
```

Additionally, if you prefer running the tests in a Docker container to ensure consistent environments:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up --build
```

This command runs all test services defined in `docker-compose.test.yml`, which ensures consistency across different developer environments.

### **Testing Strategy**

Each feature is validated through:

1.  **Unit Tests:**
    
    -   Tools: Jest (TypeScript), JUnit (Java).
        
    -   Example: Validating CRUD operations on terms.
        
2.  **Integration Tests:**
    
    -   Tools: Supertest (TypeScript), Spring Boot Test (Java).
        
    -   Example: Ensuring the compliance monitoring service works seamlessly with the market data service via Kafka.
        
3.  **End-to-End Tests:**
    
    -   Tool: Cypress.
        
    -   Example: Simulating a complete workflow where a market data update triggers a term violation alert.
        
4.  **Code Coverage Goals:**
    
    -   Aim for 90% or higher coverage for critical components (controllers, services).
        

### **CI/CD Pipeline**

We use **GitHub Actions** and **Azure Pipelines** for our CI/CD workflow. The workflow files can be found in:

-   **GitHub Actions**: `.github/workflows/build-test.yml`
    
    -   **build-test.yml**: Runs tests, builds containers, and performs code quality checks.
        
    -   **deploy.yml**: Deploys services to **Azure App Services** or **Kubernetes** after the tests pass.
        
-   **Azure Pipelines**: Configured YAML files located in `.azure-pipelines/` manage CI/CD tasks like building, testing, and deploying into cloud environments.
    

These workflows include automated testing, containerization, and deployment steps.

The project uses GitHub Actions and Azure Pipelines for CI/CD automation:

1.  **Testing:**
    
    -   Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests are executed in parallel for both stacks.
        
    -   Code coverage reports are generated and uploaded to GitHub.
        
2.  **Docker Build and Push:**
    
    -   Each service is containerized.
        
    -   Docker images are built and pushed to a container registry (e.g., Azure Container Registry or Docker Hub).
        
3.  **Deployment:**
    
    -   Deployments to Azure App Service or Kubernetes are triggered automatically upon merging to the `main` branch.
        
    -   Rollback strategies are implemented to revert failed deployments.
        

## **Project Structure**

To ensure consistency between the two implementations (**Java/Spring Boot** and **TypeScript/Express.js**), we have aligned the folder structure of **Express.js** with that of **Spring Boot**. This organisation improves readability, enforces modularity, and facilitates comparisons between the two stacks while adhering to best practices like separation of concerns.
